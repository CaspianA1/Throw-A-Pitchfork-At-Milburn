## Throw a Pitchfork at Milburn!

Click anywhere on the right side of the screen to throw your pitchfork.
If you hit him, your score goes up! Otherwise your score will go back to zero.

If you fail to hit Milburn three times in a row, he will start laughing at you!
If you're on a Mac, I recommend using the 'morse' sound effect for your terminal's beep.
You can select sound effects under 'Sound/Sound Effects' in System Preferences.
